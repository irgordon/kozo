# **KOZO**

KOZO is a modern, modular operating system written in Zig and Rust. It runs headless on servers and with a full GUI on desktops, across x86‑64, ARM64 (aarch64), and RISC‑V (riscv64). Every layer is designed privacy‑first, secure by default, and aligned with strict SOLID and Single Layer Abstraction principles.

## **Why KOZO**

- **Modular by design**  
  Each subsystem is isolated, replaceable, and cleanly bounded. No cross‑layer bleed, no hidden coupling.

- **Secure by default**  
  Defense‑in‑depth across memory, processes, capabilities, and I/O. No optional security. No legacy assumptions.

- **Predictable architecture**  
  A strict Single Layer Abstraction model ensures clarity, testability, and long‑term maintainability.

- **Headless or full GUI**  
  Runs lean on servers, fully featured on desktops. One OS, multiple execution modes.

- **Multi‑architecture**  
  First‑class support for x86‑64, ARM64, and RISC‑V with consistent behavior across all platforms.

## **Core Principles**

- **Deterministic behavior**  
  Clear boundaries, explicit capabilities, and reproducible execution paths.

- **Minimal surface area**  
  Only the essentials live in the core. Everything else is modular and optional.

- **Defense‑in‑depth**  
  Memory safety, process isolation, capability‑scoped APIs, and hardened defaults.

- **Clarity over complexity**  
  Every component has a single responsibility and a single abstraction boundary.

## **Project Structure**



## **Status**

KOZO is under active development. Architecture, modules, and platform layers are being built in parallel with strict documentation and reproducibility standards.
